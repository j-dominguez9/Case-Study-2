# Case-Study-2

Final Project DDS

Author: Joaquin Dominguez

## Introduction
Employee dataset was analyzed with multiple objectives: obtaining top three factors contributing to attrition, creating model to predict attrition, identifying specific job role trends, and creating model to predict monthly income. 


## Executive Summary
Our team divided those variables that had significant correlation to attrition into "internal" and "external" variables to prevent conflating policy objectives derived from this analysis. For the "internal" group, our top three predictors of attrition are "over time," "job involvement," and "monthly income." The best Na√Øve Bayes model to predict attrition, however, consisted of 19 variables and had an accuracy of 81%. In our analysis of job role trends, we examined gender parity in the company. First, we tested for the existence of disparity between genders with respect to monthly income in job roles. We found all job roles to be virtually equal in this regard. Next, in looking at the gender make-up of each role, we found all job roles, without exception, accounted for in the data to be occupied by more people who identified as "male" rather than "female" -- in some cases, at a 2:1 ratio. Lastly, we built a multiple regression model of 12 variables to predict monthly income. Our final model had an Adjusted R^2 of 0.95 and an RMSE of 1093. These models and insights can certainly be used in alignment of the stated directive of lowering attrition.

## Contents
Folders are divided by "Code" and "Presentation. 

"Code" folder contains all coding files used in the process of and as a product of this data analysis. Within this folder, "R_code" contains the final rmd file, as well as the R script file that was used as a notebook. Next, the "Rmd_knit" folder contains the knitted version of the rmd file in "R_Code" in pdf and html format. 

The "Presentation" folder contains all files used during the seven-minute presentation of the analysis. "Case Study 2 - DDS" holds the ppt slides used during the presentation."Video_url" holds the URL for the video recording of the presentation.
